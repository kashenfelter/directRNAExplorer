Description: Package processes, tests and visualizes the RNA sequencing data. We can convert .bam files to R .rda format, and then test differences between distributions of counts in individuals types. We can also test the differences in number of counts in genes using the negative binomial test. Then we can visualize the results of chosen test with the coverage, density plot or a histogram.
